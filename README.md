### Current features:
- Add, edit, and delete notes (data saves to Local Storage)
- A rich-text editor which allows for a variety of formatting options, image uploads, and media embeds
- Animations
- Responsive CSS based on window size

### Notes: 
- Only the delete button is currently functional in the note options menu/panel.
- I considered and researched good UX design to implement in the program
- Extensions, such as Grammarly, can slow down the editor

### Future update ideas:
- Search function
- "Reset note examples" button
- Make all other note option buttons functional (and add confirmation modal when delete is clicked)
- Ability to create and sort notes into folders
- Dark mode
- Sort notes button - based on date created, modified, and title
- Implement useContext
- Fix CSS and add some more animations
